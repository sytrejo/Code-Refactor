# Code-Refactor

I changed several items on the file to make it conform to the html semantics. 

1. I added the followimg tags in order:
    a. <header>
    b. <nav>
    c. <main>
    d. <section>
    e. <article>
    f. <aside>
    g. <footer>

2. I created the necessary classes for each tag to adapt the css file and have the code work. 

3. I anchored/linked the navigation bar to the correct area in the page. I decided to use the <article> tag because it looked 
like an abstract for a longer blog page or article linked to a home page. Thus, the website could be built upon if necessary. 

4. In the CSS style sheet, I tried to keep the original settings but merge some of the classes/elements to make it cleaner when possible. 

Overall, the assignmnet presented some challenges due to my inexperience. However, I enjoyed the practice and learnt a lot from the trial and error aspect of the homework. Thank-You.
